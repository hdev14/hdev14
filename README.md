**Hello, welcome to my profile!** 

I'm a *full stack software engineer*. I've been conding since 2016 and I love creating great software solutions. I'm a full stack, because I'm a generalist person, so I enjoy developing things, solving problems and learning everything that interests me.

For me, programming is the most **creativity** and **logic** field, and because of that it's possible to build anything you imagine. What I like the most in programming are topics about *Algorithms*, *Design of Code*, *Software Architecture* and *Tests*.

I use **TDD** in all my projects, even for the professional ones. For some people it's hard to follow this methodology, but I think it's the most correct approach when you are developing tests. Of course, in the end, it's important to have a good test coverage regardless.

My main programming language right now is *Typescript* (it's great to have a little bit of types in Javascript). But I really like the agnostic mindset of thinking that all these stuff are tools. I have programmed with PHP, C#, C, Java and Python and I'm willing to learn more. So for me, programming languages, frameworks, libs are the same, tooling!

Right now, I'm seeking to improve all my knowledge about Software Architecture, Design of Code, Data Structures and Algorithms.
