Hello, welcome to my profile. My name is **Hermerson** and I'm a *full stack software engineer*. I do code since 2016 and I love make great software solutions. I'm a full stack, because I'm a generalist person, so I just like to develop things and solve problems.

For me programming is the most **creativity** and **logic** area, and because of that it's possible to make anything you want. What I like the most in programming are topics about *Algorithms*, *Design of Code*, *Software Architecture* and *Tests*.

I realy do all my projects with **TDD** (even for the professional ones). For some people it's hard to do this methodology, but I think is the most correct approach when you are developing tests, of course in the end it's just important to have a great coverage of tests anyway.

My main programming language right now is *Typescript* (it's great to have the power of Javacript with a little bit of types). But I really like the agnostic mindset of thinking that all these stuff are tools. I have programmed with PHP, C#, C, Java and Python (and I'm learning Go and C++). So for me, programming languages, frameworks, libs are the same, tooling!

Right now, I'm seeking to improve all my knowledge about software architecture and design of code. I also have a goal this year, a hobby goal actually, to start learning about Game Development (but it's hard to have time).

All my personal projects are here on the github, so feel free to look around :).
