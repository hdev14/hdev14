**Hello, welcome to my profile!** 

I'm a *full stack software engineer*. I do code since 2016 and I love make great software solutions. I'm a full stack, because I'm a generalist person, so I like to develop things, solve problems and learn everything I want.

For me programming is the most **creativity** and **logic** area, and because of that it's possible to make anything you want. What I like the most in programming are topics about *Algorithms*, *Design of Code*, *Software Architecture* and *Tests*.

I really do all my projects with **TDD** (even for the professional ones). For some people it's hard to follow this methodology, but I think is the most correct approach when you are developing tests, of course in the end it's important to have a great coverage of tests anyway.

My main programming language right now is *Typescript* (it's great to have a little bit of types in Javascript). But I really like the agnostic mindset of thinking that all these stuff are tools. I have programmed with PHP, C#, C, Java and Python and I'm willing to learn more. So for me, programming languages, frameworks, libs are the same, tooling!

Right now, I'm seeking to improve all my knowledge about software architecture and design of code. I also have a goal this year, a hobby goal actually, to start learning about Game Development.
